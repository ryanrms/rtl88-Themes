Descriptions of the PUNK-Theme range from "easy to see," "slightly disturbed," "funky," "somehow elegant," "unhinged," "fun," "outrageous," to just "wow." They are probably all very correct statements.

This theme set showcases 4 color variations which exactly match their icon-theme counterparts.

PUNK-Theme 4-Flavor Iconpack is available for download via: https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1314524/


Choose from any of the 4 individual desktop-theme files to download.

Manual Installation Is Easy:

1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement icon theme.
