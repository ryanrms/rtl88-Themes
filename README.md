A GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell - Light Mode Theme - Plata is a new Gtk+ centered theme based on the latest Material Design refresh.

Ultimate-Plata-Light mixes white-chocolate, indigo, and shades of gray with bits of red, royal-blue, and violet. Ultimate-Plata-Light supports Gtk+ 3x, as well as Gtk+ 2, and a multitude of desktop environments like Gnome Shell (and Flashback), Xfce, Mate, and LXDE, with Cinnamon coming soon. The original Plata theme designer (who also created Adapta theme) too forwards theming support for Firefox (via FirefoxColor test pilot), Gedit, Plank dock, Telegram, and TweetDeck.

The GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell theme represents a careful blending of Material Design refresh elements, in tandem with those of minimalist artist Rafa Capoci, icon designer Wojciech Kalinowski, the Papirus team, and full-stack web-developer/themer Pavel Agarkov, with an overlay of the precise Plata theming hues.

Manual Installation Is Easy:

1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes.
